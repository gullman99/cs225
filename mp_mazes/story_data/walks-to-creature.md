The smoke slowly parts and ELon looks in wonder in the creature. It was this greyish creature with a white underbelly. Weird ovals coming from its side, and a T shape thing at its end. Elon stared at it in wonder when suddenly it let out a cry. Elon instantly felled back in shock. He reached out for it, wanting to comfort it, when he stopped. Should he help the strange creature or not?
# help-creature
Elon takes the creature back to his home.

# leave-creature
Elon leaves the creature there and walks away.
