Elon creeps towards the crater, not making a sound as he slowly creeps up to a rock and hides behind it. He can vaugly hear some cries below. His brow creases in confusion, what could have survived that impact? What confused him more is that it sounded like the cry of a child. Peeking his head out of the rock he sees through the smoke a creature.

Elon slowly makes his way down the hole and towards the creature.
