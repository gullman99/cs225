The man turns around, seemingly not even surpise someone else was up here with him. "Howdy" He says with a big smile on his face. "My name is poacher the poacher and I do love to do some poaching" Elon just stares at him, wondering how he was suppose to respond to that. "So... your a poacher?" Elon says, face palming as he realized what he just said. "Righty-oh kind sir, I do love to poach some good poaching and these poaching looking whales just look so poachable that I had to do a little poaching and poach them" How does ELon respond to that?
# stop-please
Elon ask him to stop

# chicken
ELon decides space is too weird for him and goes home.
