Elon takes the creature into his arms and brings it home. He takes care of it, feeding and bathing it. As he took care of it, he was shocked whe it began to fly. Soon the creature became fully healed and ELon knew it was time to let go. He and the creature went to the crater he found it in. The creature flys circles around ELon, and with pain in his heart he says "go". The creature looks at him with confusion in his eyes. "Its time for you to go home buddy". The creature whines and tries to move closer to Elon. ELon pushes him away "No, you need to go home. YOu can't stay here." Elon pushes him some more. The creature begins to back away, looking at ELon again. "GO, your not wanted here". THe creature finally turns around and flys away. Elon could only look on in sadness as the creature flys up, and up, directly towards the moon, until it was nothing but a tiny dot in the sky. Elon is broken from his memories as he hears the sound from earlier.
