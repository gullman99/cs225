Elon begins his long walk to the sound. As he walk closer and closer to the sound, he begins to see gaint creatures flying around each other. He finally gets close enough to see, to his horror, that they were space whales, the problem was they all seemed trapped together and could barely move without running into each other. THis caused them to moan out a sound that could be heard for miles around. As he gets close he sees someone standing by a stange contraption.
