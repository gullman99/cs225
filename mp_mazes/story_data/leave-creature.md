Elon comes back from his memerories. ELon had always regretted leaving the creature behind. When he check the crater later he couldn't find it. Later as he started looking he couldn't find anything like it on earth. The closet he came to was a whale, but it didn't have the same mystic feeling as it. He knew it had to be a creature from the moon, the only logical explanation. He hears the same sound he heard earlier
