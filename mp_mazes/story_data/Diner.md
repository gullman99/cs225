The diner is nearly empty when you arrive alone on a rainy night.  You see them across the room sitting at a table together.
You wonder what marvelous conversation Albert Einstein, Elon Musk, Margaret Thatcher, and Angela Merkel are having.

Einstein is the first to speak when you sit down: "If you choose me as your mentor, we will discover the secrets of the
universe, space, and time together."

Elon Musk grabs your hand and motions towards the back of the room: "With me on your side, you would have the brightest engineers
at the most innovative companies."

Margaret Thatcher straightened her back and clasped her hands together; she politely said, "If you'd like to work with me,
we can fix this brexit mess and renew england and europe to its former glory."

Angela Merkel looked sideways at Margaret before returning her eyes to you; she blurted out, "With me you can reform European and 
world policy to benefit the people being taken advantage of by a miriad of organizations, political and corporate."

# Diner-Team-Einstein
You grab Einstein by his shirt collar, and say; "It's you, it's always been you"

# Diner-Team-Musk
You intertwine your fingers with Elon's and you two rush out of the diner in bliss.

# Diner-Team-Thatcher
With dignity, you accept Margaret's proposition.

# Diner-Team-Merkel
You raise your pint glass and yell, "LETS BRING EQUALITY TO THE EU AND BEYOND!!"
